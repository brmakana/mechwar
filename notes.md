Entities & GameUnit
-- 
An Entity represents the model/template of a game object. For example, a mech will have an Entity modeling it. A Game Object is a concete example of an Entity. Using the previous example,
a specific Jade Falcon Adder in a scenario would be represented by a GameUnit, with a relationship to the Entity for an Adder.
